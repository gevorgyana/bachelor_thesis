a very interesting question:
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/269008/research-on-heterogeneous-neural-networks

these are related to autoencoders

Learning about backprop (there are questions)
(( to be continued ))

todo: simply refer to the models that are used by Talon:
single headed rnn;
flashlight project (models from FAcebook)

- accoustic model vs language model
- flashlight does not work under windows or on ARM.
- encoder / decoder RNN (see Goodfellow)

feb20:
- A general note: Speech Recognition and NLP are different things. Both use Deep Learning
these days. But watch this lecture for a better overview of Speech Recognition. Dragon was one of the first models used in the wild.

Need HMMs to understand these. Reading Goodfellow for that.
Need the prob. theory for that.
