a very interesting question:
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/269008/research-on-heterogeneous-neural-networks

these are related to autoencoders
[1] Learning in the Machine: Recirculation is Random Backpropagation P. Baldi and P. Sadowski August 11, 2018

Learning about backprop (there are questions)
(( to be continued ))

todo: simply refer to the models that are used by Talon:
single headed rnn;
flashlight project (models from FAcebook)

- accoustic model vs language model
- flashlight does not work under windows or on ARM.
- encoder / decoder RNN (see Goodfellow)
