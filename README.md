## The big picture

- [ ] Task #1 - using a small English-command dataset, implement a
parser for a small toy language. This is like a proof of concept.
- [ ] Task #2 - use LLVM instead of a hand-written parser. Play with
intermediate representation. Describe part of the grammmar in ANTLR.
- [ ] Taks #3 - use a real language instead of a toy language.
- [ ] Task #4 - integrate with JetBrains IDE.
- [ ] Diverged Task #5' - integrate with a chosen browser to be able to
work with Github Pull Requests, for example.
- [ ] Task #5 - implement, for a given language, a simple framework
where you would be able to not literally write code, but use the
existing blueprints (like voice pattern expansion)
- [ ] Task #6 - online Judge project corss-over. Use the technology
developed here to obtain solutions in vocal form from paricipants of
an online competition.
- [ ] New task #1. Use ffmpeg to recognize utternaces. Find if utternaces is something
we absolutely need. Is it something like lexing in parsing techniques?

- [ ] LSP protocol?

Another imprtant note.

- Implement some functional patterns? Not just d-i-c-t-a-t-e, but use descriptive commands.
